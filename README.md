## Browser Compatibility

- Speech recognition requires a modern browser with Web Speech API support
- Works best in Chrome and Edge
- Firefox has limited support
- Safari has partial support

## Troubleshooting

1. **Speech Recognition Not Working**:
   - Ensure you're using a supported browser
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Make sure you're on HTTPS (required for speech recognition in production)

2. **Translation Issues**:
   - Translation requires internet connection
   - Google Translate API has rate limits

3. **Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure both frontend and backend are running
   - Check that ports 3000 and 5000 are available

## Deployment

### Railway Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
   - Create new project from GitHub repo
   - Set environment variables:
     - `CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_api_key`
     - `PORT=5000`
   - Deploy will auto-start

2. **Deploy Frontend:**
   - Build frontend: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Deploy to Netlify/Vercel with env var:
     - `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app`

### Quick Railway Setup

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway new
railway up
```

Your backend will be available at: `https://your-project.railway.app`

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:
- `CARTESIA_API_KEY` - Your Cartesia TTS API key
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` - Backend URL for frontend

## Security Notes

- This is a development setup
- For production, implement proper authentication
- Use HTTPS for speech recognition
- Secure the Flask secret key
- Consider rate limiting and input validation# Translation
